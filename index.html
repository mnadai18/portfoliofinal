      <h1>Hi, I'm McKinley</h1>
      <p>I am a junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Information with a focus on user experience design. </p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm a student from Southwest Michigan hoping to graduate in 2023. I currently live in Ann Arbor, and I'm taking classes in subjects such as human-computer interaction, web design, graphic design, and information systems. 
        I have a lot of interests within my field, but one of mine currently is VR/AR design.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>This website goes through some of my current projects I am working on, but I also have some past experience that has been enjoyable. In my senior year of high school, I did a year-long biochemistry research project called <i>Synthesis and Anticancer Activities of Boronic Acid Chalcones.</i> This project helped me understand a lot more about managing time independently as well as the importance of testing things out, which has helped me use an interative design process in my current work. 
      In other work experience, I have been a barista for over 4 years, which is a great way to learn customer service and teamwork as well.</p>

    <div class="aboutmetext">
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I enjoy cooking, baking, and playing tennis in my free time. I love cooking things that are comforting, like pastas or soups. Another way that I like to have fun with food is cheese boards-- they are perfect for eating, but also bringing friends and family together. I also have two dogs at home, Polaris and Siri, who love to stay active and play fetch. </p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      <p>On this website, I have different pages highlighting some of my work, both in class and extracirrcular. In the Graphic Design section there is a gallery of different projects I've worked on, using different principles in photography, color, modular grids, free space, typography, and designing for both print and web. The Community Corps sections is not as specfic as the current projects are confidential, but it shows how the process works of being in this elective instead. The CLAWS page highlights a club that I'm in that 
        challenges my experience in user experience to work with augmented reality.
