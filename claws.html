      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The Nasa Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students, or SUITS for short, challenges university students to create an augmented reality interface to help facilitate astronaut autonomy and safety on the lunar surface. 
		  The challenge includes elements such as short-range navigation, long-range navigation, EVA (extravehicular activity) system state, and search and rescue.

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>To test our designs, we use the Microsoft HoloLens 2. This device is a set of glasses that can create a mixed reality environment. This device has eye tracking that can be used to select objects. as well as hand tracking to detect things like clicking a button or opening a menu. This device also lets us upload our own designs for augmented reality. </p>

      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>I am the UX Research Lead for this club. User research is a crucial part of design, especially when dealing with a specialized field such as space travel. This is why I help with coordinating research interviews and testing. 
		  Through talking with astronauts and other professionals in space research, our team has been able to gain a deeper understanding of how lunar missions work and what designs can help with making astronaut's jobs easier.
