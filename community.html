		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>Even though this elective is part of the School of Information, it is open to all University of Michigan students, because the projects can be very interdisciplined. Topics can include things like data analytics, user experience, or web design.
			 Students don't have to have any prior experience in order to apply-- just a passion to learn and help with a social justice project.

		<h2>Specifics</h2>
		<p>For my project, I started work on it during October of 2021 and will continue until around Feburary 2022. My project is confidential, but does involve my group 
			working to create a blueprint for a company to utilize in order to optimize their website design to meet their goals. This project is a great opportunity to 
			practice my skills in user experience, human-computer interaction, user research, and working with stakeholders.
